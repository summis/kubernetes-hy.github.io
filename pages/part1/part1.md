In this part we'll go over a lot of things you need to get yourself started with using Kubernetes. This includes terminology, your first deploy, a little bit of networking and introduction to volumes. By the end of this part you will be able to

- Create and run a Kubernetes cluster locally with k3d

- Deploy applications to Kubernetes

## What is Kubernetes? ##

“Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.” - [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/)

A container orchestration system such as Kubernetes is often required when maintaining containerized applications. The main responsibility of an orchestration system is the starting and stopping of containers. In addition, they offer networking between containers and health monitoring. Rather than manually doing `docker run critical-bank-application` every time the application crashes, or restart it if it becomes unresponsive, we want the system to keep the application automatically healthy.

A more familiar orchestration system may be docker-compose, which also does the same tasks; starting and stopping, networking and health monitoring. What makes Kubernetes special is the robust feature set for automating all of it.

Read this comic to get a fast introduction <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/kubernetes-comic/>. You may want to revisit the comic after this part!

We will get started with a lightweight Kubernetes distribution. [K3s - 5 less than K8s](https://k3s.io/), offers us an actual Kubernetes cluster that we can run in containers using [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d).

### Kubernetes cluster with k3d ###

#### What is a cluster? ####

A cluster is a group of machines, *nodes*, that work together - in this case they are part of Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes cluster consists of at least two nodes, one worker and one master.

#### Starting a cluster with k3d ####

We'll use K3d to create a group of docker containers that run k3s. Thus creating our very own Kubernetes cluster.

```console
$ k3d create -w 2
```

This created a Kubernetes cluster with 2 worker nodes. As they're in docker you can confirm that they exist with `docker ps`.

```console
$ docker ps
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
  57f8952c0cb3        rancher/k3s:v1.0.1   "/bin/k3s agent"         7 seconds ago       Up 6 seconds                                 k3d-k3s-default-worker-1
  324954c08977        rancher/k3s:v1.0.1   "/bin/k3s agent"         9 seconds ago       Up 7 seconds                                 k3d-k3s-default-worker-0
  088cd949015e        rancher/k3s:v1.0.1   "/bin/k3s server --h…"   10 seconds ago      Up 8 seconds        0.0.0.0:6443->6443/tcp   k3d-k3s-default-server
```

Here we also see that port 6443 is opened to "k3d-k3s-default-server", our master node, and that's how we can access the contents of the cluster. K3d helpfully set up a *kubeconfig*, the location of which is output by `k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default'`. kubectl will read kubeconfig from the location in KUBECONFIG environment value so set it: `export KUBECONFIG="$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')"`.

Now kubectl will be able to access the cluster: `kubectl cluster-info` outputs the address of the master in port 6443. 

If you want to stop / start the cluster you can simply run

```console
$ k3d stop
  INFO[0000] Stopping cluster [k3s-default]
  INFO[0000] ...Stopping 2 workers
  INFO[0000] ...Stopping server
  INFO[0001] Stopped cluster [k3s-default]

$ k3d start
  INFO[0000] Starting cluster [k3s-default]
  INFO[0000] ...Starting server
  INFO[0000] ...Starting 2 workers
  INFO[0001] SUCCESS: Started cluster [k3s-default]
```

For now we're going to need the cluster but if we want to remove the cluster we can run `k3d delete`.

## First Deploy ##

### Preparing for first deploy ###

Before we can deploy anything we'll need to do a small application to deploy. During the course you will develop your own application. The technologies used for the application do not matter - for the examples we're going to use [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) but the example application will be offered through GitHub as well as Docker Hub.

Let's create an application that generates and outputs a hash every 5 seconds or so.

I've prepared one [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/tree/master/app1) `docker run jakousa/dwk-app1`.

To deploy we need the cluster to have an access to the image. K3d offers `import-images` command, but since that won't work when we go to non-k3d solutions we'll use the now very familiar registry *Docker Hub*.

```console
$ docker tag _image_ _username_/_image_
$ docker push _username_/_image_
```

> In the future the material will use the offered applications in the commands. Follow along by changing the image to your application

Now we're finally ready to deploy our first app into Kubernetes!

### Deployment ###

To deploy an application we'll need to create a *Deployment* with the image.

```console
$ kubectl create deployment hashgenerator-dep --image=jakousa/dwk-app1
  deployment.apps/hashgenerator-dep created
```

This action created a few things for us to look at: a *Deployment* and a *Pod*.

#### What is a Pod? ####

A *Pod* is an abstraction around one or more containers. Similarly as you've now used containers to define environments for a single process. Pods provide an context for 1..N containers so that they can share a storage and a network. They can be thought of as a container of containers. *Most* of the same rules apply: it is deleted if the containers stop running and files will be lost with it.

![]({{ "/images/part1/pods.png" | absolute_url }})

#### What is a Deployment? ####

A *Deployment* takes care of deployment. It's a way to tell Kubernetes what container you want, how they should be running and how many of them should be running.

The Deployment also created a *ReplicaSet*, which is a way to tell how many replicas of a Pod you want. It will delete or create Pods until the number of Pods you wanted are running. ReplicaSets are managed by Deployments and you should not have to manually define or modify them.

You can view the deployment:
```console
$ kubectl get deployments
  NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  hashgenerator-dep   1/1     1            1           54s
```

And the pods:
```console
$ kubectl get pods
  NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  hashgenerator-dep-6965c5c7-2pkxc   1/1     Running   0          2m1s
```

1/1 replicas are ready and it's status is Running! We will try multiple replicas later.

To see the output we can run `kubectl logs -f hashgenerator-dep-6965c5c7-2pkxc`

A helpful list for other commands from docker-cli translated to kubectl is available here [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/docker-cli-to-kubectl/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/docker-cli-to-kubectl/)

{% include_relative exercises/1_01.html %}

{% include_relative exercises/1_02.html %}

## Declarative configuration with YAML ##

We created the deployment with 

```console
$ kubectl create deployment hashgenerator-dep --image=jakousa/dwk-app1
```

If we wanted to scale it 4 times and update the image:

```console
$ kubectl scale deployment/hashgenerator-dep --replicas=4`

$ kubectl set image deployment/hashgenerator-dep dwk-app1=jakousa/dwk-app1:78031863af07c4c4cc3c96d07af68e8ce6e3afba`
```

Things start to get really cumbersome. In the dark ages deployments were created similarly by running commands after each other in a "correct" order. We'll now use a declarative approach where we define how things should be. This is more sustainable in the long term than the iterative approach.

Before redoing the previous let's take the deployment down.

```console
$ kubectl delete deployment hashgenerator-dep
  deployment.apps "hashgenerator-dep" deleted
```

and create a new folder named `manifests` to the project and a file called deployment.yaml with the following contents (you can check the example [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/tree/master/app1)): 

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hashgenerator-dep
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hashgenerator
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hashgenerator
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: hashgenerator
          image: jakousa/dwk-app1:78031863af07c4c4cc3c96d07af68e8ce6e3afba
```

> I personally use vscode to create these yaml files. It has helpful autofill, definitions and syntax check for Kubernetes with the extension Kubernetes by Microsoft. Even now it helpfully warns us that we haven't defined resource limitations.

This looks a lot like the docker-compose.ymls we have previously written. Let's ignore what we don't know for now, which is mainly labels, and focus on the things that we know:

* We're declaring what kind it is (kind: Deployment)
* We're declaring it a name as metadata (name: hashgenerator-dep)
* We're declaring that there should be one of them (replicas: 1)
* We're declaring that it has a container that is from a certain image with a name

Apply the deployment with `apply` command:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/deployment.yaml
  deployment.apps/hashgenerator-dep created
```

That's it, but for revisions sake lets delete it and create it again:

```console
$ kubectl delete -f manifests/deployment.yaml
  deployment.apps "hashgenerator-dep" deleted

$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app1/manifests/deployment.yaml
  deployment.apps/hashgenerator-dep created
```

Woah! The fact that you can apply manifest from the internet just like that will come in handy.

{% include_relative exercises/1_04.html %}


## Networking Part 1 ##

Restarting and following logs has been a treat. Next we'll open an endpoint to the application and access it via HTTP.

#### Simple networking application ####

Let's develop our application so that it has a HTTP server responding with two hashes: a hash that is stored until the process is exited and a hash that is request specific. The response body can be something like "Application abc123. Request 94k9m2". Choose any port to listen to.

I've prepared one [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/tree/master/app2). By default it will listen on port 3000.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app2/manifests/deployment.yaml
  deployment.apps/hashresponse-dep created
```

### Connecting from outside of the cluster ###

We can confirm that the hashresponse-dep is working with `port-forward` command. Let's see the name of the pod first and then port forward there:

```console
$ kubectl get po
  NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  hashgenerator-dep-5cbbf97d5-z2ct9   1/1     Running   0          20h
  hashresponse-dep-57bcc888d7-dj5vk   1/1     Running   0          19h

$ kubectl port-forward hashresponse-dep-57bcc888d7-dj5vk 3003:3000
  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3003 -> 3000
  Forwarding from [::1]:3003 -> 3000
```

Now we can view the response from http://localhost:3003 and confirm that it is working as expected.

{% include_relative exercises/1_05.html %}

External connections with docker used the flag -p `-p 3003:3000` or in docker-compose ports declaration. Unfortunately Kubernetes isn't as simple. We're going to use either a *Service* resource or an *Ingress* resource.

#### Before anything else ####

Because we are running our cluster inside docker with k3d we have to do a few preparations.
Opening a route from outside of the cluster to the pod will not be enough as we have no means of accessing the cluster inside the containers!

To illustrate:

```console
$ docker ps
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
  83dde7d5fcac        rancher/k3s:v1.0.1   "/bin/k3s agent"         3 days ago          Up 23 hours                                  k3d-k3s-default-worker-1
  00b2dff4b2a9        rancher/k3s:v1.0.1   "/bin/k3s agent"         3 days ago          Up 23 hours                                  k3d-k3s-default-worker-0
  6a3bef5af379        rancher/k3s:v1.0.1   "/bin/k3s server --h…"   3 days ago          Up 23 hours         0.0.0.0:6443->6443/tcp   k3d-k3s-default-server
```

As you can see only port 6443 is open (this is used by kubectl). Let's delete our old cluster and create a new one with ports 8081 and 8082 open:

```console
$ k3d delete
  INFO[0000] Removing cluster [k3s-default]               
  INFO[0000] ...Removing 2 workers                        
  INFO[0022] ...Removing server                           
  INFO[0036] ...Removing docker image volume              
  INFO[0036] Removed cluster [k3s-default]

$ k3d create --publish 8081:80 --publish 8082:30080@k3d-k3s-default-worker-0 --workers 2
  INFO[0000] Created cluster network with ID   903e292db40363804d315ff9543414e58cf1bbdb5985c5e61b9941ed4bc29679 
  INFO[0000] Created docker volume  k3d-k3s-default-images
  ...

$ export KUBECONFIG="$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')"
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app2/manifests/deployment.yaml
  deployment.apps/hashresponse-dep created
```

Now we've opened port 8081 to our master and 8082 to one of our workers port 30080. They will be used to showcase different methods of communicating with the servers.

> We will have limited amount of ports available in the future but that's ok for your own machine.

> Your OS may support using the host network so no ports need to be opened.

#### What is a Service? ####

As *Deployment* resources took care of deployments for us. *Service* resource will take care of serving the application to connections from outside of the cluster. 

Create a file service.yaml into the manifests folder and we need the service to do the following things:

1. Declare that we want a Service
2. Declare which port to listen to
3. Declare the application where the request should be directed to
4. Declare the port where the request should be directed to

This translates into a yaml file with contents

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hashresponse-svc
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: hashresponse
  ports:
    - name: http
      nodePort: 30080 # This is the port that is available outside. Value for nodePort can be between 30000-32767
      protocol: TCP
      port: 1234 # This is a port that is available to the cluster, in this case it can be ~ anything
      targetPort: 3000 # This is the target port
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/service.yaml
  service/hashresponse-svc created
```

As we've published 8082 as 30080 we can access it now via http://localhost:8082.

We've now defined a nodeport with `type: NodePort`. *NodePorts* simply ports that are opened by Kubernetes to **all of the nodes** and the service will handle requests in that port. NodePorts are not flexible and require you to assign a different port for every application. As such NodePorts are not used in production but are helpful to know about.

What we'd want to use instead of NodePort would be a *LoadBalancer* type service but this "only" works with cloud providers as it configures a, possibly costly, load balancer for it. We'll get to know them in part 2.

There's one additional resource that will help us with serving the application, *Ingress*.

{% include_relative exercises/1_06.html %}

#### What is an Ingress? ####

Incoming Network Access resource *Ingress* is completely different type of resource from *Services*. If you've got your OSI model memorized, it works in the layer 7 while services work on layer 4. You could see these used together: first the aforementioned *LoadBalancer* and then Ingress to handle routing. In our case as we don't have a load balancer available we can use the Ingress as the first stop.

This will require us to create two new resources. Ingress will route incoming traffic again to *Services*, but the old *NodePort* Service won't do. 

```console
$ kubectl delete -f manifests/service.yaml
service "hashresponse-svc" deleted
```

In this case we will need to declare

For resource 1 the new *Service* we want a simpler version of the one above. A ClusterIP resource that will let TCP traffic from port XXXX to port 3000:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hashresponse-svc
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: hashresponse
  ports:
    - port: 2345
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 3000
```

For resource 2 the new *Ingress*.

1. Declare that it should be an Ingress
2. And route all traffic to our service

```yml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dwk-material-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: hashresponse-svc
          servicePort: 2345
```

Then we can apply everything and view the result

```console
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/service.yml
  service/hashresponse-svc created
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/ingress.yml
  ingress.extensions/dwk-material-ingress created

$ kubectl get svc
  NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
  kubernetes         ClusterIP   10.43.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    23h
  hashresponse-svc   ClusterIP   10.43.236.27   <none>        2345/TCP   4m23s

$ kubectl get ing
  NAME                    HOSTS   ADDRESS      PORTS   AGE
  dwk-material-ingress    *       172.28.0.4   80      77s
```

We can see that the ingress is listening on port 80. As we already opened port there we can access the application on http://localhost:8081.

## Volumes Part 1 ##

Storage in Kubernetes is **hard**. In part 1 we will look into a very basic method of using storage and return to this topic later. Where almost everything else in Kubernetes is very much dynamic, moving between nodes and replicating with ease, storage does not have the same possibilities.

There are multiple types of volumes and we'll get started with two of them.

### Simple Volume ###

Where in docker and docker-compose it would essentially mean that we had something persistent here that is not the case. There are multiple types of volumes *emptyDir* volumes are shared filesystems inside a pod, this means that their lifecycle is tied to a pod. When the pod is destroyed the data is lost.

Before we can get started with this, we need an application that shares data with another application. In this case it will work as a method to share simple log files between each other. We'll need to develop the apps:

App 1 will check if /usr/src/app/files/image.jpg exists and if not download a random image and save it as image.png. Any HTTP request will trigger a new image generation.

App 2 will check for /usr/src/app/files/image.jpg and show it if it is available.

They share a deployment so that both of them are inside the same pod. My version available [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/tree/master/app3). The example includes ingress and service to access the application.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: images-dep
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: images
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: images
    spec:
      volumes: # Define volume
        - name: shared-image
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: image-finder
          image: jakousa/dwk-app3-image-finder:a04092af0393067d08280db7a79057eaab67692b
          volumeMounts: # Mount volume
          - name: shared-image
            mountPath: /usr/src/app/files
        - name: image-response
          image: jakousa/dwk-app3-image-response:31a78aec1090d7ea44446d2f9af621a2c59efe72
          volumeMounts: # Mount volume
          - name: shared-image
            mountPath: /usr/src/app/files
```

As the display is dependant on the volume we can confirm that it works by accessing the image-response and getting the image. The provided ingress used the previously opened port http://localhost:8081

Note that all data is lost when the pod goes down.

{% include_relative exercises/1_10.html %}

### Persistent Volumes ###

This type of storage is what you probably had in mind when we started talking about volumes. Unfortunately we're quite limited with the options here and will return to *PersistentVolumes* briefly in Part 2 and again in Part 3 with GKE.

The reason for the difficulty is because you should not store data with the application or create a dependency to the filesystem by the application. Kubernetes supports cloud providers very well and you can run your own storage system. During this course we are not going to run our own storage system as that would be a huge undertaking and most likely "in real life" you are going to use something hosted by a cloud provider. This topic would probably be a part of its own, but let's scratch the surface and try something you can use to run something at home.

A *local* volume is a *PersistentVolume* that binds a path from the node to use as a storage. This ties the volume to the node.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: example-pv
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi # Could be e.q. 500Gi. Small amount is to preserve space when testing locally
  volumeMode: Filesystem # This declares that it will be mounted into pods as a directory
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  local:
    path: /tmp/kube
  nodeAffinity: ## This is only required for local, it defines which nodes can access it
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - k3d-k3s-default-worker-0
```

> As this is bound into that node avoid using this in production.

The type *local* we're using now can not be dynamically provisioned. A new *PersistentVolume* needs to be defined only rarely, for example to your personal cluster once a new physical disk is added. After that a *PersistentVolumeClaim* is used to claim a part of the storage for an application.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: image-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Let's apply a modified deployment that uses it:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app3/manifests/deployment-persistent.yaml
```

With the previous service and ingress we can access it from http://localhost:8081. To confirm that the data is persistent we can run

```console
$ kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app3/manifests/deployment-persistent.yaml
  deployment.apps "images-dep" deleted
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-hy/material-example/master/app3/manifests/deployment-persistent.yaml
  deployment.apps/images-dep created
```

And the same file is available again.

## Summary ##

In this part we learned about k8s, k3s and k3d. We learned about resources that are used in Kubernetes to run software as well as manage storage for some use cases, for example, caching and sharing data between Pods.

By now we know what the following are and how to use them:
 - Pods
 - Deployments
 - Services
 - Ingress
 - Volume

With them we're ready to deploy simple software to a Kubernetes cluster. In the next part we'll learn more about management as well as a number of cases where the tools we have acquired so far are not enough. [Part 2](/part2)
